## How to use it (WIP)

For now, you can just clone this repo and...

1. Npm or Yarn install its deps: `npm install`
1. Build your own application you wanna test and serve it on a local port (i.e. 9999)
1. Use [angular.spec.js](https://github.com/manekinekko/perfy/blob/master/specs/angular.spec.js) as an example
1. Run `npm start`. This will run the perf compain tests
1. All reports will be generated in the [public](https://github.com/manekinekko/perfy/tree/master/public) folder
1. Run a local server to serve the public folder
1. Enjoy üéâ

## Notes

Benchpress will write all its JSON reports in the [public](https://github.com/manekinekko/perfy/tree/master/public) folder, and name them like so: `sample-id_TIMESTAMP.json`:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210312207.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210351209.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210397529.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210444576.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210490802.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210538966.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210584509.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478210605446.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219206794.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219255917.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219284622.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219319050.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219368862.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219417463.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219466122.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paint-with-web-component_1478219515129.json
```

Perfy will then merge all those files into a single file named `paint-with-web-component.json`. This file will eventually contain all samples from each timestamped files. It will also update the [index.html](https://github.com/manekinekko/perfy/blob/master/public/index.html#L8-L9) to load that new file `paint-with-web-component.json` (or any other merged file, of course).

So, you just need to serve the public folder, run your perf compaigns and after each compaign you can refresh the perfy UI to view the updated generated data from Benchpress.
